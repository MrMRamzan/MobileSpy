## Android java Assignment 
The purpose of this assignment is to help you explore Android’s capabilities for
using phone sensing to gather information about the phone state and the user's
behaviour and context. Once again, you will add a new button to your Market
app: "Track Me." When this button is pressed, it should pop a screen or series of
screens with as much information as possible about what YOU are up to with
your phone since the app was installed, nicely summarised and organised.
This is assignment is open-ended. Your goal is to gather as much information
as you can and then organise and present it. Ideas you might explore are the
following:

* What type of phone is Stephen running the app on and what are the
implications for your app (screen size, available sensors?)
* How much memory does the phone have left and of what type?
* What is known about use of the phone for phone calls?
* What is know about your's texting routine?
* Where is the phone (and therefore You?)?
* Has the phone (and therefore You) been moving much? How much of the
day?
* Can the camera and/or microphone be used to gather any information
about what You are doing?
* What apps are installed on Your phone?
* What is Your email?
* How much time are You spending using the phone?
* Can information be gathered from any other sensors?
**NOTE:** Work is done but without use of services
